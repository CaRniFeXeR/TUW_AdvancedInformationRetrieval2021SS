### Results

| Model | Test-Set | Batches |  Training Loss    |  Validation MRR@10 | Test MRR@10  | Comment |
|-------:|------:|----:|----:|----:|----:|----|
| KNRM | MSMARCO | 12323 | 0.123 | 0.23  | 0.23 | super nice run |


## Part 2

    todo describe used model for extractive qa; which reranker model is used; results on fira etc.
    - generate result files from our best reranking model
    - evaluate qa results and write report

## Part 3

    todo visualize tk model vs. fk model in neural ir-explorer and tell a story
    - get neural ir-explorer running
    - generate secondary results for tk and fk model
    - explore with the ir-explorer and search for interesting differences (e.g.: where fk model failed to watch for context)
